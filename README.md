Control the Kemper from Web

This is a design draft! Any real functionality is not implemented yet. The midi Connection should be done with bluetooth, so this should be useable with android!

When pressing an Fx button there is a dual functionality: 

Long press brings up the offcanvas element (selecting an fx or setting it off)
Short press brings up the parameter of the fx
