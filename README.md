# KEKO-WEB
Control the Kemper from Web

This is a design draft! Any real functionality is not implemented yet. The midi Connection should be done with bluetooth(i use a cme widi pro), so this should be useable with android!

When pressing an Fx button there is a dual functionality: 

Long press brings up the offcanvas element (selecting an fx or setting it off)
Short press brings up the parameter of the fx
 
As of now (04.02.2023) i will switch to a rather conventional midi cable to do the development.
With Android i could net receive sysex from the Kemper, on windows 10 i got crashes after a few received sysex (shutting down the browser!).
Another advantage is that i could linux to code, which is way more convenient than with an offline WIN 10.
